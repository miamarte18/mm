 <h3>Sophomore in college at <strong> Palm Beach State College.</strong> </h3>
 <p>I was born and raised in Dominican Republic, and moved to the states at the age of 12. Coming from a house where Spanish was our native language,
   I had to self- teach myself English. It was not easy at first, but over the years my writing and reading got better.
   Now you may ask, what got me into computer?
   Well, while growing up, I was always fascinated about computers but I never knew where to start.
   Not going to lie, I never thought I was going to be able to code, but at least now I know the basis(print(Hello World!)).
   I'm still a beginner in the tech world, and my goal is to do something with technology that will be useful to someone out there. <p>
